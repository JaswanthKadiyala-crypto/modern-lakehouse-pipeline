## 🚀 How to Proceed

### Path 1: Learn & Understand (Recommended)
```bash
1. Read: docs/START_HERE.md
2. Read: docs/QUICKSTART.md
3. Read: docs/foundation_explained.md
4. Run:  make setup
5. Explore: UIs at localhost:8080, 9000, 5000
6. Understand: How services communicate
```

### Path 2: Immediate Testing
```bash
1. Run:    make setup
2. Wait:   2-3 minutes for services
3. Check:  docker-compose ps (should show 9 running)
4. Test:   curl http://localhost:8080/health
5. Explore: Airflow UI, MinIO UI, MLflow UI
```

### Path 3: Deep Dive First
```bash
1. Read:   README.md (understand what it does)
2. Read:   docker-compose.yml (understand services)
3. Read:   Dockerfiles (understand images)
4. Read:   spark-defaults.conf (understand config)
5. Run:    make setup
6. Monitor: make logs
```

## ✅ Pre-Phase 2 Checklist

Before moving to Phase 2 (Data Ingestion), verify:

- [ ] You can run `make setup` without errors
- [ ] All 9 services start successfully
- [ ] You can access Airflow UI (http://localhost:8080)
- [ ] You can access MinIO UI (http://localhost:9000)
- [ ] You can view logs with `make logs`
- [ ] You understand what each service does
- [ ] You understand why we use each tool
- [ ] You can explain the architecture to someone

## 🎯 Phase 2 Preview

**Coming Next: Data Ingestion Layer**

Will create:
```python
# ingestion/generator_streaming.py
- IoT sensor data simulation
- Temperature, humidity, timestamp
- Upload to MinIO: s3://lakehouse/raw/events/
- 100+ events per run

# ingestion/upload_files.py
- Batch file upload
- Device metadata CSV
- Upload to MinIO: s3://lakehouse/raw/files/
- Integration with Airflow

# Integration test
- End-to-end data flow
- From generator → MinIO
- Verify in UI
```

**What you'll learn:**
- Python data generation
- S3/MinIO API usage
- Data format design
- Error handling
- Logging patterns

## 💼 Recruiter Talking Points

Use this for interviews:

> "I built a complete data lakehouse infrastructure from scratch with 9 interconnected services. I orchestrated PostgreSQL, MinIO, Apache Spark, Airflow, and MLflow in Docker, configured multi-service communication, implemented S3 connectivity for both Iceberg and Delta Lake formats, and created one-command deployment using Make. All supported by comprehensive IaC documentation showing production-grade patterns including error handling, monitoring, and reproducible environments."

## 🔍 Quick Verification Checklist

```bash
# Run these to verify everything is set up correctly:

# 1. Check Git status
git status
# Should show: repository initialized, untracked files

# 2. Check file structure
ls -la infra/
ls -la ingestion/
ls -la spark_jobs/
# Should show all folders exist

# 3. Check docker-compose syntax
docker-compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml config
# Should output full configuration without errors

# 4. Check Python syntax
python -m py_compile ingestion/requirements.txt
# Should succeed silently

# 5. Check Makefile
make help
# Should display all available commands
```
